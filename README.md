Project Recipes App is a web application that allows users to search for recipes and save their favorite recipes. This repository contains the source code and assets for the application. This is a group project that I developed together with Alexandre Belem, Breno Lavalle Garrido, Vitor Breno Chacon E Silva and Vitor Alves.

Getting started

To run the application locally, you need to have a web server and a modern web browser installed on your machine. Here are the steps to get started:

    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash

git clone https://github.com/JaronMorren/project-recipes-app.git

    Navigate to the project-recipes-app directory:

bash

cd project-recipes-app


Usage

The application allows users to search for recipes by name or ingredients. Users can also save their favorite recipes by clicking the "Add to favorites" button. The saved recipes are stored in the browser's local storage and can be accessed even after closing the application.
Structure

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main page is index.html, and the CSS styles are in styles.css. The assets directory contains the images and other static files used by the application. The JavaScript code is split into multiple files in the js directory.

The application uses the MealDB API to fetch recipe data.
